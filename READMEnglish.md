The technological advances of the last decade, from the digitization of content and the means of production and distribution to the popularization of broadband, as well as the flood of screens and Internet access devices in daily life, have allowed it to increase spectacularly the offer of digital content that is available for user consumption. This new consumption framework has intensified old problems related to marketing or sociology, while facilitating the implementation of new techniques and tools to solve them. These problems affect both producers and sellers and users. On the one hand, producers have the need to find the right audience to which they can direct their commercial offering; On the other hand, users are overwhelmed by the excess of supply, sometimes because they are not able to determine what they want or like, or they simply want to discover products hitherto unknown to them within a certain domain of knowledge. .

From the user's perspective, the traditional problem presented a duality. On the one hand, he was faced with the challenge of locating what he was looking for when he had prior knowledge about the nature of his search. On the other hand, he was faced with the difficulty of finding information when he lacked clarity about the way it should be. In both scenarios, the solution manifested itself as an act of consultation or obtaining guidance from expert or trusted individuals who possessed a greater degree of knowledge in a specific area.

This is why it is necessary to have automatic or semi-automatic tools that provide recommendations, in order to help find information, products or services more efficiently. These tools help filter the available information, allowing it to be used in a better way. It is in this context where recommendation algorithms come into play. These algorithms have the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, such as preferences, behaviors and specific characteristics, and using machine learning techniques, they can select and recommend only those that are truly relevant and in line with the user's requirements.

The goal of recommendation algorithms is to provide the user with a personalized and manageable list that is of high quality and fits their needs. By applying these algorithms, the time and effort that the user must invest in searching and reviewing a wide range of information is significantly reduced. In addition, personalized recommendations are essential so that the client can focus on the essential core of their search and find the most valuable resources in the sea of available information.

In this repository, a recommendation system is developed based on a hybrid approach, which combines various techniques with the aim of offering consumers a selection of multimedia material that fits their individual preferences. To achieve this purpose, an amalgamation of two approaches is implemented in the recommendation process.
In an advanced recommendation approach, a cascade hybridization system has been implemented that starts with the application of a collaborative filtering algorithm based on the Pearson Correlation metric. This process is activated immediately after the user is authenticated on the platform, with the aim of generating content recommendations that optimally adapt to the preferences of other users with similar tastes.
In the first stage, the collaborative filtering algorithm identifies users with similar rating histories to the initial user. Pearson Correlation is used to measure the similarity between user ratings, thus establishing relevant connections between profiles. This initial phase provides initial recommendations based on the collective preferences of like-minded users.

A content-based filtering process is then implemented to refine and improve recommendations. In this second stage, those elements that have received exceptionally high ratings from the user community are prioritized. The content recommended in this phase is not only similar to the preferences of the initial user, but has also proven to be especially valued by users with similar tastes.
